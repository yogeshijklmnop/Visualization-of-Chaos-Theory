# Visualization-of-Chaos-Theory
An interactive dashboard that shows three chaotic equations as well as the intriguing features of Chaos Theory

The main component of this project is 'Dboard.py' file. To launch the interactive dashboard, simply execute the following command: "streamlit run Dboard.py" in your terminal. The dashboard is built using Streamlit.
 
While the main focus is on the interactive dashboard, several additional files were initially created to explore the chaotic equations in detail. These files have been integrated into the main dashboard. But feel free to explore the files if you're interested in the intricacies of the chaotic equations.
